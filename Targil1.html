        <p> This page is using HTML. What you see here is an interpretation of some HTML code I wrote, and this may be the most boring website ever.
            But don't you worry; it'll get a lot more interesting further.

            <a href = "https://sports.news/"> Sport News </a>

        <h2> Have fun </h2>
